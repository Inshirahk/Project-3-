Overview

This project provides interactive visualizations and analytical tools to explore trends in drug overdose deaths from 2019 to 2024. The visualizations offer insights into temporal trends, substance-specific impacts, and geographic distributions, helping users better understand the changes in overdose death rates over time.

Features

1. Visualizations

Temporal Trends & Substance-Specific Trends:
-Created by Maryann and Cordette.
-Implemented a donut chart to display Drug Overdose Deaths by Drug Involved for each year (2019-2024) and an overall donut chart summarizing the entire period.
-Interactive Features: Hover over the chart to view drug-specific death counts and percentages.
-Developed an immersive bar graph that visualizes Overdose Deaths by Year, Jurisdiction, and Drug Type, allowing users to filter by drug type and observe regional impacts.

Insights: The data shows an increase in overdose deaths peaking in 2023, followed by a 50% drop in 2024. Additionally, heroin exhibited a steady decline in overdose deaths, unlike other substances.

2. Usability & Web Implementation

-Developed by Logan and Fitsum using JavaScript.
-Logan created the main index and HTML structure to integrate the visualizations.
-Fitsum worked on reformatting data and structuring HTML files to optimize the display of visualizations.
-The result is a web-based interface that presents the data in three interactive tabs.

3. Data Processing & Exporting

SQL Data Structuring: Tyquese developed an SQL script that refines the database schema by removing unnecessary tables, restructuring data storage, and ensuring consistent column naming.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Isaiah imported datasets into pandas dataframes, handled missing values, and added a "Region" column to the VSRR dataset. This new column standardized geographic classifications, enhancing regional analysis.

4. Geographic Analysis

-Developed by Inshirah using cleaned data.
-Created an interactive map that color-codes states by year, illustrating the regions most affected by drug overdoses over time.

5. Presentation

PowerPoint Creation: Charles created the PowerPoint presentation for the project, summarizing key insights, data analysis, and visualizations for effective communication.


Technologies Used:

-Python (pandas, numpy, SQL) for data cleaning and structuring.
-JavaScript (D3.js, HTML, CSS, Leaflet) for interactive visualizations.
-SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB) for database management.
-Plotly for advanced data visualization.
